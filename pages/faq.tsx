                            iCoder is a place where programmers from all over
                            the world come together to solve problems in a wide
                            range of Computer Science domains such as
                            algorithms, machine learning, or artificial
                            intelligence, as well as to practice different
                            programming paradigms like functional programming.

                            Congratulations, your code passed all the test

                            The output your code produced didn't match the
                            output expected by the test case. Rethink your
                            approach and think about whether you misunderstood
                            the problem or missed a corner case.

                            Your code doesn't solve the problem efficiently
                            enough! If you write a O(2n) solution when n = 100,
                            it will surely time out and you're going to need to
                            optimize your algorithm. The time limits are
                            different for each language (some languages are
                            slower than others), and you can see the limits for
                            all the languages we support at our Environment page

                            Your code terminated unexpectedly. Did you overrun
                            your array? Is your code trying to divide by zero?

                            Are you using too many resources? Maybe an array you
                            created is too large and exceeds the memory limit,
                            or an assert statement in your code is failing.

                            confusing!" don't communicate enough information for
                            people to know what you're talking about, so it's
                            always best to be courteous and specific (e.g., "The

                            or undirected?") when asking for help.
